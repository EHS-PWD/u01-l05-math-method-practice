# Unit 01 - Lab 06: Math Methods Practice

In this activity, you’ll complete a series of JavaScript exercises using common **Math methods**. These challenges are designed to help you explore rounding, powers, roots, and random numbers just like developers do in real-world problem solving.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this challenge, you will be able to:

- 🔢 Round numbers up or down using `Math.ceil()` and `Math.floor()`  
- ➖ Find absolute values and minimum/maximum values  
- 🧮 Raise numbers to powers and calculate square roots  
- 🎲 Generate and control random numbers  
- 🧰 Use Math methods in debugging and code analysis

**Math Methods Practiced:**  
`Math.ceil()` · `Math.floor()` · `Math.round()` · `Math.max()` · `Math.min()` · `Math.abs()` · `Math.pow()` · `Math.sqrt()` · `Math.random()`

## 🪄 Challenge Instructions

Complete the following exercises by writing a single line of code that uses a JavaScript Math method.

1. Find the ceiling of `41.2`  
2. Find the floor of `29.6`  
3. Round the number `-93.5`  
4. Return the **maximum** from: `90.5, 23, -12, 78, 7`  
5. Return the **minimum** from: `90.5, 23, -12, 78, 7`  
6. Return `7` raised to the `4th` power  
7. Return `-3` raised to the `3rd` power  
8. Return the square root of `81`  
9. Return the square root of `1000`  
10. Return the square root of `-27`  
11. Return a **random whole number** between `6` and `11`
